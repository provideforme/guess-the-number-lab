// ## Features

// - Allow the player to continually be prompted to enter their guess at the secret number until they guess correctly.
// - If the player has an incorrect guess, display an alert message that informs the player:
//     - Whether their guess is too high or too low, andâ€¦
//     - A list of all the previously guessed numbers (without showing the square brackets of an array).
// - If the player has guessed the secret number:
//     - Display an alert message that congrats the player and informs them of how many guesses they took.
//     - End the gameplay.
